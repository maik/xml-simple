= XmlSimple - Easy API to maintain XML (especially configuration files)

I have translated the original Perl version of this module (XML::Simple)
to Ruby, because I often have to work with XML files and the approach
of XML::Simple was one of the best I have ever seen. It only provides
two functions (xml_in and xml_out), that let you convert XML strings into
a nice memory structure and vice versa.

For further information and a really nice tutorial have a look into the
doc directory of the distribution.

== Installation

See INSTALL.

== Ideas

I still have some ideas for XmlSimple on my "to do" list and I will
watch the development of the Perl version. If you miss a feature or
think you have a good idea that would make this library even more
useful, just let me know.

== Development

Of course, active developers that will improve XmlSimple are
always welcome. Contact me!
